# WinFormButtonNav
Allows the user to navigate to different buttons with the arrow keys naturally, instead of them being used for "tabbing" and "reverse-tabbing"

In order to navigate through buttons in a more natural way, check the checkbox when starting the program and then you'll be able to navigate with the arrow keys.
